    "en-UK": "The casing of the drill is made from plastic, specifically polycarbonate (PC) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and features rubber for the handles and non-slip parts. The motor incorporates materials such as copper, steel, and iron, with neodymium magnets. The battery is a lithium-ion (Li-ion) type and includes components made of copper, aluminum, and steel. The electronics involve printed circuit boards (PCBs) composed of copper, tin, and gold, and use lead-free solder."

  "hazardousSubstances": {
    "en-UK": "1. Battery (lithium-ion) contains lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) at 15-20%, graphite (carbon) at 10-15%, and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6) as the electrolyte at 5-10%. It also includes copper (Cu) at 10-20%, aluminum (Al) at 5-10%, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).\n2. Motor copper (Cu) in the windings at 30-50%, steel and iron (Fe) in the rotor and stator at 40-60%, and neodymium (Nd) in the magnets at 1-5%.\n3. Plastic parts are made of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) at 20-30%, polycarbonate (PC) at 10-20%, and polyamide (nylon) at 5-10%.\n4. Electronic circuit boards contain lead (Pb) in the solder at 2-5%, gold (Au) in connectors and contacts at less than 0.1%, and copper (Cu) in traces and wiring at 10-20%.\n5. Gearbox and mechanical parts are composed of steel (Fe) and other alloys at 60-80%."

  "recyclingInstructions": {
    "en-UK": "1. The battery: Drop off the battery at a recognised collection point for lithium-ion batteries.\n2. Plastic parts: Sort the different types of plastics (ABS, polycarbonate etc). Recycle the plastics according to local guidelines for plastic waste.\n3. Metal parts: Remove all screws, shanks, and other metal parts. Sort the metals (steel, aluminum, copper etc) and drop off at a metal recycling plant.\n4. Electronic components: Sort the PCBs, switches and cables. Deliver these components to a specialised electronic waste center."
