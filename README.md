# DPP Harmonizing Data Dictionary (Keystone)

This repository provides a centralized, harmonized vocabulary for the EU Digital Product Passport (DPP). It contains an open-source library of JSON-LD definitions that map the semantic equivalencies between various standards (ISO, GS1, Schema.org, etc.) required for the DPP.

Our goal is to ensure interoperability and lower the barrier for implementation, especially for SMEs.

## Project Structure

This repository uses a source/build structure to separate development files from production-ready artifacts.

*   `src/`: This directory contains all the **source files** for the ontology, contexts, validation shapes, and examples. **All edits and contributions should be made here.** These files may contain comments for clarity.
*   `dist/`: This directory contains the **generated, production-ready files** that are deployed to the live site. The files in this directory are automatically generated by the build process, which strips all comments. **Do not edit files in this directory directly.**
*   `testing/`: Contains the validation and integration test suite.
*   `scripts/`: Contains the build and clean scripts.

## Local Development

To work with this project locally, you will need Node.js installed.

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the dependencies for both the root build process and the testing suite.

```bash
# From the project root, install build dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to the testing directory and install test dependencies
cd testing
npm install
cd ..
```

### 2. Build Production Files

To generate the clean, comment-free files in the `dist/` directory, run the build command from the project root.

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Run Tests

To validate the data models and examples, run the test command from the project root.

```bash
npm test
```
